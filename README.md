# Lemmy_API_test
A test tool for the Lemmy API written in Python

As of right now this tool only runs expected behavior tests that require no auth. As further test sets are built this README will be updated.

To run:

1. Update conf.conf file with the API address under the "server" field,
2. create unique username and admin_username (and passwords if you prever) in conf.conf
3. run test.py

Other options in the configuration file do not currently work, but will work soon.
